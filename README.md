# Wallpapers

These are all the wallpapers I have collected.

I try to keep this repo up to date.

## Notes

This repository is _kinda_ big at around >1.53 GBs (checked on April 28, 2024), therefore I recommend you browse to find only the wallpapers you like instead of downloading everything at once.

If you clone this repo with bad WiFi, start praying to God if there is one.

## Installation

If you have `git` installed, just run this command to clone this repo to your pictures directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/michaelScopic/Wallpapers.git ~/Pictures
```

Alternatively, you can [download this repository as a `.zip` file](https://github.com/michaelScopic/Wallpapers/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and then extract it.

### Credits

A huge majority of the wallpapers here I got from the [r/unixporn Discord server](https://discord.gg/unixporn)
